# Internationalization Package Overview

Internationalization supports the design and development of applications that work in multiple cultures. The culture defines specific information for the number, date, and time formats as well as the week and month names.

The Internationalization provides methods for parsing and formatting dates and numbers using the [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)](http://cldr.unicode.org/) data.

The package includes:

* **CLDR**&mdash;Provides locale information for the `dates` and `numbers` modules.    
* **Date Parsing** and **Date Formatting**&mdash;Provide methods for parsing and formatting dates.
* **Number Parsing** and **Number Formatting**&mdash;Provide methods for parsing and formatting numbers.
* **General Formatting**&mdash;Provides methods for placeholder and type independent formatting.
